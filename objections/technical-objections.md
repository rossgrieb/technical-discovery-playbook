# Common Technical Objections

## “We’re concerned about quality.”
Response:
Define a measurable quality bar, run a short pilot, and compare outputs directly. Avoid abstract debates, instead test against agreed criteria.

## “Security or compliance might block this.”
Response:
Surface constraints early. Identify data types, access controls, storage, and audit requirements before expanding scope.

## “Integration sounds complex.”
Response:
Start with the smallest viable integration that proves value. Confirm inputs, outputs, owners, and dependencies up front.

## “We don’t have bandwidth right now.”
Response:
Clarify what *not* doing this costs. Align on a scoped next step that minimizes lift while preserving momentum.
