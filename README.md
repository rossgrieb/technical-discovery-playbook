# Technical Discovery Playbook

This repository contains practical templates and frameworks I use to run effective technical discovery, align stakeholders, and move opportunities forward in technical sales environments.

The focus is on clarity, risk reduction, and execution. My task is turning ambiguous needs into concrete next steps that both technical and business teams can agree on.

This is not code.
It is my operating system for working well with technical buyers and internal product or engineering teams.

## Philosophy

Strong technical sales outcomes come from:

- asking better questions earlier
- identifying pain points quickly
- documenting assumptions clearly
- and agreeing on success before discussing solutions.

Most deals stall not because of technology, but because of misalignment.
This playbook exists to prevent that.
