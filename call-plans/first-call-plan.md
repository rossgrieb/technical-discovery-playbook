# First Call Plan (Technical Sale)

## Objective
Confirm the problem, surface constraints, and agree on a concrete next step.

## Agenda (25–30 minutes)
1. Context and goals (3 min)
2. Current workflow and pain points (8 min)
3. Desired future state and success criteria (7 min)
4. Constraints and risks (7 min)
5. Next step, owner, and date (3 min)

## Questions I must answer by the end of the call
- Why is this a priority now?
- What breaks if nothing changes?
- How will success be measured?
- Who needs to be involved technically and commercially?
- What constraint could block this later if not addressed now?

## Possible Next Steps
- Technical deep dive
- Pilot or proof-of-concept
- Security / procurement review
- Mutual Action Plan alignment
