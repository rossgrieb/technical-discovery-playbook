# Discovery Questions (Technical + Business)

## Outcomes
- What does success look like 30–60 days after implementation?
- Which metrics would meaningfully improve if this works?

## Current State
- Walk me through the current workflow end-to-end.
- Where does quality, speed, or reliability break down today?
- What is the cost of the current approach?
- What is the downside if you don't get this fixed in the next 30-60 days?

## Constraints
- What systems does this need to integrate with?
- Any security, compliance, or data constraints?
- What timeline are you working toward, and why?

## Stakeholders
- Who owns the budget?
- Who signs off technically?
- Who feels the pain day-to-day?

## Decision Process
- What needs to be true for you to move forward?
- What could cause this to stall or stop?
